# Grafana Loki configuration parameters

{{ .GeneratedFileWarning }}

Grafana Loki is configured in a YAML file (usually referred to as `loki.yaml` )
which contains information on the Loki server and its individual components,
depending on which mode Loki is launched in.

Configuration examples can be found in the [Configuration Examples]({{ `{{< relref "./examples/" >}}` }}) document.

## Printing Loki config at runtime

If you pass Loki the flag `-print-config-stderr` or `-log-config-reverse-order`, (or `-print-config-stderr=true`)
Loki will dump the entire config object it has created from the built-in defaults combined first with
overrides from config file, and second by overrides from flags.

To output the YAML configuration object generated by Loki (loki.yaml), pass the flag `-print-config-stderr`
or `-log-config-reverse-order` (or `-print-config-stderr=true`) to Loki. This object is created by combining
built-in defaults with overrides from the configuration file and then with overrides from the flags.

The output will include every configuration option in the Loki configuration structure. It is important to
note that many of the values in the configuration object may not be relevant to your installation,
such as storage configs that you are not using and did not define. This is normal, as 
every option has a default value whether it is being used or not.

This output can be an invaluable tool for debugging configuration-related issues. It is especially
useful for verifying that your configuration files and flags are being properly read and loaded.

When running Loki directly (for example,  ./loki), the `-print-config-stderr` flag is useful for quickly outputting 
the entire Loki configuration.

In our environments, we run Loki with the `-log-config-reverse-order` flag, which reverses the order
of the configuration entries so that they read correctly from top to bottom in Grafana's Explore.

## Reload at runtime

Loki is capable of reloading its configuration during runtime. However, if the new configuration
is not properly structured, the changes will not be applied. To initiate a configuration reload,
you can either send a `SIGHUP` signal to the Loki process or submit a HTTP POST request to the `/reload`
endpoint. The /reload endpoint can only be accessed if the `--server.enable-runtime-reload` flag is enabled.

## Configuration file reference

To specify which configuration file to load, pass the `-config.file` flag at the
command line. The value can be a list of comma separated paths, then the first
file that exists will be used.
If no `-config.file` argument is specified, Loki will look up the `config.yaml` in the
current working directory and the `config/` subdirectory and try to use that.

The file is written in [YAML
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), defined by the scheme below.
Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

### Use environment variables in the configuration

> **Note:** This feature is only available in Loki 2.1+.

You can use environment variable references in the configuration file to set values that need to be configurable during deployment.
To do this, pass `-config.expand-env=true` and use:

```
${VAR}
```

Where VAR is the name of the environment variable.

Each variable reference is replaced at startup by the value of the environment variable.
The replacement is case-sensitive and occurs before the YAML file is parsed.
References to undefined variables are replaced by empty strings unless you specify a default value or custom error text.

To specify a default value, use:

```
${VAR:-default_value}
```

Where default_value is the value to use if the environment variable is undefined.

Pass the `-config.expand-env` flag at the command line to enable this way of setting configs.

### Generic placeholders

- `<boolean>` : a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
- `<int>` : any integer matching the regular expression `[1-9]+[0-9]*`
- `<duration>` : a duration matching the regular expression `[0-9]+(ns|us|Âµs|ms|[smh])`
- `<labelname>` : a string matching the regular expression `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`
- `<labelvalue>` : a string of unicode characters
- `<filename>` : a valid path relative to current working directory or an absolute path.
- `<host>` : a valid string consisting of a hostname or IP followed by an optional port number
- `<string>` : a string
- `<secret>` : a string that represents a secret, such as a password

## Runtime Configuration file

Loki has a concept of "runtime config" file, which is simply a file that is reloaded while Loki is running. It is used by some Loki components to allow operator to change some aspects of Loki configuration without restarting it. File is specified by using `-runtime-config.file=<filename>` flag and reload period (which defaults to 10 seconds) can be changed by `-runtime-config.reload-period=<duration>` flag. Previously this mechanism was only used by limits overrides, and flags were called `-limits.per-user-override-config=<filename>` and `-limits.per-user-override-period=10s` respectively. These are still used, if `-runtime-config.file=<filename>` is not specified.

At the moment, two components use runtime configuration: limits and multi KV store.

Options for runtime configuration reload can also be configured via YAML:

```yaml
# Configuration file to periodically check and reload.
[file: <string>: default = empty]

# How often to check the file.
[period: <duration>: default 10s]
```

Example runtime configuration file:

```yaml
overrides:
  tenant1:
    ingestion_rate_mb: 10
    max_streams_per_user: 100000
    max_chunks_per_query: 100000
  tenant2:
    max_streams_per_user: 1000000
    max_chunks_per_query: 1000000

multi_kv_config:
    mirror-enabled: false
    primary: consul
```

## Accept out-of-order writes

Since the beginning of Loki, log entries had to be written to Loki in order
by time.
This limitation has been lifted.
Out-of-order writes are enabled globally by default, but can be disabled/enabled
on a cluster or per-tenant basis.

- To disable out-of-order writes for all tenants,
place in the `limits_config` section:

    ```
    limits_config:
        unordered_writes: false
    ```

- To disable out-of-order writes for specific tenants,
configure a runtime configuration file:

    ```
    runtime_config: overrides.yaml
    ```

    In the `overrides.yaml` file, add `unordered_writes` for each tenant
    permitted to have out-of-order writes:

    ```
    overrides:
      "tenantA":
        unordered_writes: false
    ```

How far into the past accepted out-of-order log entries may be
is configurable with `max_chunk_age`.
`max_chunk_age` defaults to 2 hour.
Loki calculates the earliest time that out-of-order entries may have
and be accepted with

```
time_of_most_recent_line - (max_chunk_age/2)
```

Log entries with timestamps that are after this earliest time are accepted.
Log entries further back in time return an out-of-order error.

For example, if `max_chunk_age` is 2 hours
and the stream `{foo="bar"}` has one entry at `8:00`,
Loki will accept data for that stream as far back in time as `7:00`.
If another log line is written at `10:00`,
Loki will accept data for that stream as far back in time as `9:00`.
